There are broad applications of high aspect ratios and high quality holes. However, it is difficult for conventional drilling methods to obtain high quality holes while keeping vibrations, forces and thermal evolution on check. This automated 1 axis drill provide a promising solution for efficient drilling of deep holes with high precison material removal, reduced cracks or breakage of workpiece, minimized heat- affected zones. monitoring the system is crucial in determining optimal drilling parameters which can in turn be usec in a system control. On the same note, this research analyzes the behaviour of PMMA during the drilling action. Finally, the analysis of the material composition could helpm other students or researches in studying plastic behaviour to heat and stress
